Version 27
There may be a newer one on github: https://github.com/Yonisen/WarThunder_Yellow_Mark_Rangefinder

If your monitor is not supported, then write Yonisen#3035 in the discord
i will add support for your monitor

You should know that this is mostly a google translation but I think you will understand the meaning


Preparing:

Install on your computer:
Python 3.10.6
	https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.6/python-3.10.6-amd64.exe
	!!! at the beginning of the installation, check the box "add python.exe to PATH"

Double-click to run the file "install.py" from the distance folder
The console will open, wait for the installation to complete, the console will close itself

The above steps only need to be done once.
Now the program is ready to work


Setting up WarThunder:

Set game resolution to fullscreen window (options-graphics:mode)
Set minimap size to 133% (largest) (options-mainParameters-groundVehicleBattleSettings:tacticalMapScale)
Assign a button to the yellow mark (controls-common:setTargetForSquad)
Wartunder is now configured

Setting up program:

Go to distance folder
Double-click to run the file "settings.py"
Choose the screen resolution and
assign combinations for distance measurement and scale setting or leave the default values (t and Ctrl+N),
also, if you want, you can change the positioning and transparency of the overlay
Save changes by pressing "Apply"
I recommend using the same button for distance measurement as for the yellow mark

(example string for keyboard:
					distance measurement = <ctrl>+<alt>+<shift>+k+f)
(examples for the mouse:
					distance measurement mouse = left
					mouse scale setting = middle)

If you are not sure how to correctly designate the mouse button
run testMouse.py script by double click and click this button
it will show you its correct designation
If you want to return the default values press "Default"

How to start the rangefinder?

Go to distance folder

Double click to run the python script "miniMap.py"
The console will open, after a while the inscription should appear: "The program is waiting for a keystroke"
This inscription indicates the successful launch of the script

Everything is ready to go

When you get to a new map in the WT, look at the scale of the minimap in the lower right corner
Press keyboard shortcut for setting scale (by default Ctrl+N)
A window with a map scale will open
compare the value in the "s.number" line with the actual scale of the map
if the values are different, press Alt to see the in-game cursor
click on the black square on the overlay and copy the number from the minimap (4 digit limit)
after that, click on the "scale" button
the value in the string "s.number" will change
After that, I advise you to close the scale window

Now you can measure the distance
Aim at the point to which you want to measure the distance
(you can aim from a sight, from binoculars and from a third person)
Put a yellow mark and press the key to measure the distance (default t)
These actions can be assigned to the same button
The distance will appear as an additional temporary overlay (for 7 seconds)


This completes the guide for working with the program, further is details


Sometimes it will happen that you will see an inscription on the screen:
"Your tank was not found" or "Mark not found"
This indicates that the neural network could not find
Required object on the minimap
This means that the neural network needs more data for additional training.
And you have them
If you look in the folder distance/not_found
You will be able to find all cases of false measurments that have occurred
While you were using the program
Once you have enough data
You can send them to me, and I will train an existing neural network
So that it would not be mistaken in such situations again.


Possibly in very rare cases
You will see a standard overlay of distance and azimuth
Which for some reason are obviously wrong
It is easier to understand this by azimuth, for example, not 190 degrees, but 350
In this case, to identify the error, minimize the game
Open the folder distance, there you will see a temporary screenshot
"Map.png", this is the screenshot by which the program measured the range
Also, the results are saved in the console after each measurement.
Copy the extreme measurement data to notepad
And copy the screenshot
In a separate folder
After that, you can figure out what caused the error.
To do this, open the "Map.png" file with Paint
And check if the coordinates are correct
The tank position from the console is the center of the triangle in the screenshot
The center of the yellow mark. This is clear
Next, the coordinates of the letters
These letters are in the screenshot on the left, such a column as in a naval battle
Check the coordinates of the top left corners of those
What is used to calculate the scale
If there was an incorrect measurement of the distance, then somewhere there must be
mismatch between screenshot and console
Finding this discrepancy, it will be possible to understand what the error is.
And edit the script




Interesting features:
Sometimes, especially when your tank is not horizontal
The azimuth on the overlay starts showing some shit
He writes 262.4 and on the compass in the WT you can see 261.9
So this is not an overlay fouled
If you put your tank on its side, you will go crazy because the compass is smeared all over the screen
You don't have to worry about it, the accuracy of measuring the distance does not depend on the inclination of your tank

But it is worth noting that when you leave the minimap, the label of your tank changes
and does not go beyond the minimap, although you can travel quite far
Range, in this case, is calculated as usual, according to the triangular mark on the minimap
And the accuracy depends on how far you have gone from the center of this mark.
If you move away from the edge of the map by 100 meters, then your distance from the center of the triangular mark will be approximately 120-140 meters
That is, if the range measurement shows 900 meters, then the actual range is 1020-1040 meters

This rangefinder has an error due to non-absolute accuracy of recognition of two objects on the minimap
(yellow mark and triangle of your tank) with two neural networks. The error is supposedly 3-4 pixels
What on fullHD screens gives a spread of +-20 meters, regardless of the distance
(A tank is 100 meters away, the rangefinder may show 80, a tank is 1000 meters away, the rangefinder may show 1020)
This may not be enough to throw AVRE shells 3 kilometers into the tank hull
(The point is the excessive "parabolic" trajectory of the projectile in this case. When it flies from top to bottom, these 20 meters can turn into a miss)
(But if the projectile flies more or less straight, and hits the target as to the side, the vertical window for hitting the tank can reach 100 meters)
(Think for yourself, when the enemy is close to you, 300 meters, you can aim at him with a mark of 100 or 500 on the scope, and still
the mark will be within the silhouette of the tank and you will hit)
Also, the inaccuracy is introduced by the fact that the rangefinder does not work with a large map, but with a minimap
The main purpose of this rangefinder is to give players
On all sorts of 34s, Shermans, KV-2s
The ability to quickly measure the distance and make a shot

The whole process is built on screenshots and an overlay

Regarding the distance measurement speed:
When you press the button
The yellow mark does not appear on the screen immediately
On my computer it appears after 200-250ms
I don't know what caused it, the computing power or something else
Therefore, I set a timeout in my program (300 ms) so that it does not take a screenshot ahead of time
If you ever notice on your computer that you have put a yellow mark in an obvious place,
and the program will write to you that the label was not found
Let me know, I will increase the timeout
If you have a powerful computer and want to try reducing the latency
Then open the "miniMap.py" file with a code editor (Notepad++) and change the line that says: time.sleep(0.3)

It is also worth noting if you start measuring the distance and at the same time hold an extraneous key
For example W, to move forward, and after measuring the range, you still have not released this key
Then its effect is canceled, that is, the tank stops as if the key was not pressed
This is because during the execution of the script, the focus from the warthunder window disappears for a moment.

It is also worth considering that the distance on the overlay is closest to reality if you are with the enemy
are at the same height, if the enemy is higher or lower than you, then the distance will be slightly underestimated
compared to reality
